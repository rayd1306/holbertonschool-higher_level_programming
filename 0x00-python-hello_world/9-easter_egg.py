print("The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters\n\nBeautiful is better than ugly.\nExpl\
icit is better than implicit.\nSimple is better than complex.\nComplex is bette\
r than complicated.\nFlat is better than nested.\nSparse is better than dense.\
\nReadability counts.\nSpecial cases aren't special enough to break the rules.\
\nAlthough practicality beats purity.\nErrors should never pass silently.\n\
Unless explicitly silenced.\nIn the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to\
 guess.\nThere should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\
\nAlthough that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.\nNow is be\
tter than never.\nAlthough never is often better than *right* now.\nIf the im\
plementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.\nIf the implementation is eas\
y to explain, it may be a good idea.\nNamespaces are one honking great idea -- \
let's do more of those!")
